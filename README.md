# Data-Science-Capstone
Coursera Data Science Capstone project 
In this capstone, I took on the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company, Space Y. This company would like to compete with SpaceX in terms of successful rocket launches. I determineD the price of each launch by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards. i also determined if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
